WHAT IS THIS?
-------------
After spending a long time to find an IRC client that suited my needs, and is free of cost, I found none.
So I decided to make my own and hopefully this one could be the ideal client for you aswell.
Relased under the GNU GPL v2, I hope you who read this will help out making the most Ideal IRC client there is.
The aim is to have the client as simplistic as possible as a base, and use scripting to expand features.


HOW TO COMPILE?
---------------
This is the easy part. All you need is Qt5 dev tools/libraries.
$ qmake
$ make
That's about it.


HOW TO CONRIBUTE?
-----------------
For the time being (December 2013) you could send me your .patch file on E-mail, post@tomatix.com and I'll review it.
If it's good and I think this is awesome/required/whatever, it's applied and if you wish you could be added as Contributor, just make
sure you send me the details you'd like me to add, such as your name/nickname, email (optional).
