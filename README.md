Fork by Daniel Jones (daniel_j) 
I wanted to use IdealIRC and make it more ideal to myself.

### WHAT IS THIS?

After spending a long time to find an IRC client that suited my needs, and is free of cost, I found none.  
So I decided to make my own and hopefully this one could be the ideal client for you aswell.  
Relased under the GNU GPL v2, I hope you who read this will help out making the most Ideal IRC client there is.  
The aim is to have the client as simplistic as possible as a base, and use scripting to expand features.  


### HOW TO COMPILE?

This is the easy part. All you need is Qt5 dev tools/libraries.  
$ qmake  
$ make  
That's about it.


### HOW TO CONRIBUTE?

For the time being (September 2015) you could send me your .patch file on E-mail, post@tomatix.com and I'll review it.
Stop by irc.3pg.org #Offtopic aswell!
If it's good and I think this is awesome/required/whatever, it's applied. I don't bite!
if you wish you could be added as Contributor, just make sure you send me the details you'd like me to add, such as your name/nickname, email (optional).
